        When I was younger I would love to ride my tiny bike around the colony I lived in. I still love to ride my bike now, with my dad we would got to trails and ride our bikes there. One of the things I love about biking is that you can ride and travel much faster and farther then running and without using all yor energy. With the wind flying by when I bike, its not only a good expiriance its a good exersize to. I cant forget the first time I learnd how to ride a bike without traning weels. my dad pushed me as I peadeld trying to stay balenced and not falling over. Over all biking is wonderful and everyone should do it.
